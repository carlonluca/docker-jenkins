ignored:
  # Exclusions in this section have been triaged and determined to be false
  # positives.
  - DL3008  # Pin versions in apt-get install
  - DL3018  # Pin versions in apk add
  - DL3033  # Specify version with yum install -y <package>-<version>
  - DL3041  # Specify version with dnf install -y <package>-<version>

  # Here lies technical debt. Exclusions in this section have not yet been
  # triaged. When working on on this section, pick an exclusion to triage, then:
  # - If it is a false positive, add a "# hadolint ignore=<rule>" suppression,
  #   then remove the exclusion from this section.
  # - If it is not a false positive, fix the bug, then remove the exclusion from
  #   this section.
  - DL3006  # Always tag the version of an image explicitly
